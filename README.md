Transportation and mobility business insights
This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Project Challenge 13, where I play the role of a Data Analyst for Goodcabs, a fictional cab service company.
The goal is to analyze trip and passenger data, answer business questions, and present insights visually through a Power BI dashboard.
